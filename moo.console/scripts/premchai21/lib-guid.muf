( This attempts to resolve the problem of programs not having a good
  way to distinguish between two objects that have the same dbref but
  are referenced at different times and have different identities.

  An object that gets recycled will not have the same GUID as the object
  that gets created afterwards with the same dbref, and two objects with
  different dbrefs will not have the same GUID.
 
  Interface:
    objguid ( d -- s )
      Obtain the GUID of an existing object.
    guidobj ( s -- d )
      Obtain the object associated with a given GUID, or #-1.
