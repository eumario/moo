bug that Cara found.  Be _CERTAIN_ to read the README.NOW file for instructions

fuss.

CHANGES MADE BETWEEN RELEASE 1.04 AND RELEASE 1.18 OF TERRAFORM
---------------------------------------------------------------
 
- Diddled the order of looking for player's location so it is more solid and
  people can safely teleport around and use teleport objects.
 
- The '!' terrain type now can use local/global fail/ofail set with
  @editterrain (The default is still "You can't go that way." and "").
 
- Added support for 'inside' rooms and building in the vertical direction
  (this used to be a problem).
 
- Added support for terrain library rooms so that a number of map rooms
  can share terrain types (good for standardization, saves memory).
 
- Made the room destroyer sleep for 1 second before starting so that
  Riss's RIDE and other programs can finish what they need to do
  before the room goes *poof*. 
 
- Modified: now only player positions are tracked with @/occupants; this used
  to be a problem if a zombie entered the world and was @rec'd.
 
- Added on-the-fly sanity checking to make sure that the dbref
  stored in the @/rooms propdir is valid.  It might NOT be valid,
  for instance, if someone has @rec'd the room in question.  Note
  that if it has since become ANOTHER spot on the planet, this will
  NOT be detected... hence weirdness could still result.  But at least it
  doesn't crash.
 
- Added version control for automatic upgrades
 
- Added sanity checker @sanity to help perform installation of
  upgrades, expose possible deficiencies in terrain coverage, and
  correct problems in the @/rooms/ and @/occupants/ propdirs.
 
- Added @killworld for single-command @rec'ing of ALL the generated rooms in
  a world.
 
- Added the @inside command that frees up the vertical axis, regardless of
  fly/diver permission props, for the current room.  Directions can then
  be @block'ed and the builder can therefore freely build up and down now,
  too.
  
- Removed @recycle command as a potential cause of trouble since it now does
  on-the-fly sanity checking.
  
- Added the @admin command which allows the owner of a world or region or map
  to list any number of other characters as co-admins of that area.
 
- Added the @own command which allows an admin to claim ownership of a
  generated room so that s/he can edit it.
