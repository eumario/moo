All these MUF programs are designed for use with TinyMUCK
version 2.2fb6.00rc5 

On a new FB server, that doesn't have the FB libraries set
up yet, install cmd-@register first, then install std-defs.
After that, install these libraries in this order:

  lib-strings
  lib-stackrng
  lib-props
  lib-lmgr
  lib-edit
  lib-gui
  lib-editor
  lib-match
  lib-mesg
  lib-mesgbox
  lib-look
  lib-reflist
  lib-index
  lib-case
  lib-mpi

Then you can install the rest of the programs as you wish.

To install a program or library, simply quote it to the FB server,
using tinyfugue's /quote feature, or something equivalent.

NOTE: These installation scripts assume that the player installing
the programs is a Wizard.  (This, to register globals on room #0,
and to set the mucker levels appropriately.)
